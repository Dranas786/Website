Images to change:

1. In assests logo image (and as the name stays the same don't need to change it in constants/images.js export and import)
2. Change profile too
3. Line 61 ib Header.jsx has flutter and redux as images, might switch it with things I have skills in
   If addedor removed skills also remove or add the thing below in header.scss
   div:nth-child(1) {
   width: 100px;
   height: 100px;
   }
   4.Change the abouts object array in About.jsx (can also change the logo in the file) (and also change the image urls in this array of about objects)
